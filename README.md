# pyvisa-control-Rigol-DG4162
This is my project when i'm intern at PT. Len Industry. I and my team had finished just one month from three months given. We use python programming language because python is open source so it has many libraries and easy to learn.

The first that you have to do before add the code in python is download python in version 2.7 or 3.4. Because pyvisa just work with python 2.7 or 3.4

After that you must add many libraries:
1. setuptools.py
2. python-usbtmc-master
3. pyusb
4. libusb
